# Testing-a-Perceptual-Phenomenon-
Compute descriptive statistics and perform a statistical test on a data set based on psychological phenomenon,the Stroop Effect.
In this project, I  have investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. I  have learnt a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task. I will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, I will interpret my results in terms of my hypotheses.
